# Glimmr

Our project is the back end for Glimmr, a pilot program for a dating app serving a test group of 1,000 users for eight weeks (the average expected lifetime of an account). Glimmr is our attempt to address the gender gap on dating apps by putting women’s user experience first. We believe that in doing so, we’ll create a better experience for everyone.
